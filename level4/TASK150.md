# Analogue to Digital Conversion
In this task, we look at another flow-control technique, `switch-case`. 

| TASK150 | Using `AnalogIn` |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Make Task150 the active program |
| 2. | Build and run the code. |
| 3. | Shine a torch on the light dependent resistor and note the change in value displayed "
| 4. | Turn the blue potentiometer dial and note the change in value. What are the maximum and minimum values? |
| 5. | Why are you not getting constant values for any of these inputs? |

What is happening here? The values you observe are each the output of an Analogue to Digital Converter:
