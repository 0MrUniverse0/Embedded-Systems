[Embedded Systems in Context - Level 4](README.md)

---

# Digital Outputs
This topic is designed to get you started. This include familiarization wit the hardware, software tools and some basic embedded programming in C++

## Week 1
In week 1, we begin by familiarizing ourselves with the equipment and software. 

> This includes ensuring you have completed all items in the [getting started section](../getting_started/README.md)

We then begin to look at some basic electrical concepts and some examples of programming a microcontroller to control digital outputs.
