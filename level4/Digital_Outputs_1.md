# Digital Outputs (Week 1)
This topic is designed to get you exposed to writing embedded C/C++ and hopefully, give you a feel for the wider subject of embedded systems. This includes familiarization with the hardware, software tools and some basics of C/C++

In week 1, we will take some time to familiarize ourselves with the equipment and software. We don't want to be overly ambitious at this stage. It is better to invest some time learning to use the tools so we can focus on the coding aspects in subsequent weeks. 

> This includes completing all items in the [getting started section](../getting_started/README.md)

To give this context, we then begin to look at some basic electrical concepts and some examples of programming a microcontroller to control digital outputs.

## Lectures
The lectures for this week cover some basic concepts
