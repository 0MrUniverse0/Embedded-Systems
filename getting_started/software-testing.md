# Testing the Software
Once you are confident the hardware is working, we can turn our attention to programming.

For this, we will use Mbed Studio to perform the following steps:

1. Open the sample code (written in the language C++)
1. **Build** the code into something the target computer can understand
1. **Deploy** and **execute** the code on the target board
1. **Edit** the code in Mbed Studio to make a small change
1. Finally, we will **debug** the code, stepping through line by line

## Opening Task101 - Blinky!
When learning to program an embedded computer, the tradition is to run "Blinky", a program that simply flashes an LED on and off. This is very simple to do in Mbed.
