# Troubleshooting

If any of the previous steps fail, it is best to contact a member of staff, either in person, or via Teams.

* When you connect your ST Board, it should appear as an external storage device on your computer. Browsing this drive you should see two files. If not, inform the module staff and maybe use Teams to screenshare so they can diagnose the problem.

* One of the most common issues is the "firmware" on the Nucleo Boards. This firmware is partly responsible to maintaining the connection between the host PC and the Target. You can update to the latest version using the [ST Link Update Tool](software-tools.md#ST-Link-Drivers-and-Utilities).

* On the ST Link, check the power light is GREEN and not red. If Red, this suggests the USB port may not be able to supply sufficient power.
