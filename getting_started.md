# Getting Started

In this section, we will look at how to setup your own development environment so that you can work on your own computer. 

## Hardware
There are two pieces of hardware provided with this course:

### Target Board - ST-Nucleo-F429ZI
The computer you will be programming is a small low-cost microcontroller based on the [Arm Cortex M4](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m4)

* The microcontroller is a [STM32F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f429zi.html) made by [ST Microelectronics](www.st.com)
* The board which hosts this device is a [ST-Nucleo-F429ZI](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F429ZI/)

An image of the Nucleo board is shown below:

This board is connected to your PC using a USB connector. Do not connect this yet.

   > It might be worth noting that Arm Ltd. design the core of Cortex M microcontroller, but you do not manufacture any silicon.


### University of Plymouth Module Support Board
The [Nucleo Target Board](#Target-Board-ST-Nucleo-F429ZI) 

## Software

* All the software we use is free
* Where possible, software is supported cross platform

1. Installing Mbed Studio
1. Installing ST Link Tools
1. Connecting and updating your development board 
1. GitHub Desktop
1. Testing your board
