# C++ and Object Orientated Programming 
In this 2-part lab, we will explore object orientated techniques in C++. We begin with structures, which feature in both C and C++. Then we move to classes, which feature in C++ and are one of the main differentiating features between the two languages.  

C++ is an "Object Orientated Language", whereas C is procedural. You can think of C++ as an extension of the C language, inheriting most of it's attributes and syntax.

Central to this is the "Class". To understand Classes, we need to remind ourselves about structures.

## Structures
C and C++ both have structures. These are extremely useful for packaging data into a single object.

### Dots, Arrows, Value and Reference Semantics
This all sounds confusing I appreciate!

### Passing by value and reference

### Writing an API

## Enumerated Types

## Two-Switch Problem as a FSM

## Classes

### Creating a Simple Class

### References and Pointers

### Simple Device Driver
